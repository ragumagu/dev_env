# dev_env
My development environment scripts.

I have been working on a Windows machine for a few years now.

I use [Dual Key Remap](https://github.com/ililim/dual-key-remap) to 
modify certain keys on my keyboard:

    spacebar as space / control
    capslock as escape / control
    shift as backspace / shift

This makes it easier to use certain keyboard shortcuts, and I don't
have to take my fingers off of the home row. :)

I use NeoVim, and my NeoVim config is inspired by ThePrimeagen's NeoVim
setup.
